# About
Here are all the various projects, homeworks, and labs I worked on in CS61A of Spring 2022 using Python, Scheme and Visual Studio Code! The skills utilized in these projects are about controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

There are some missing assignments that I was not able to upload to Github due to errors: Lab05, Lab07, Homework08, Scheme. Will be updated once ressolved! README files for the projects are still a work in progress!

# What is The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS61A)?
"The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

1.) CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

2.) CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.

3.) CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors. The class also uses two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL)" ([Syllabus](https://cs61a.org/articles/about/))

# Useful Resources
Here is a list of resources that I used in CS61A which greatly helped me in the course.
- [Class Textbook by John DeNero](http://composingprograms.com/) <-- For refreshing concepts.
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/cp/composingprograms.html#mode=edit) <-- A tool used for visualizaing code execution, great for debugging and environment diagrams.
- [Practice Exams](https://cs61a.org/resources/) <-- In order to do well in CS61A exams, you have to work on previous exams frequently, refresh concepts, and receive help through [CS61A Office Hours](https://cs61a.org/office-hours/) or [HKN](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/tutor/). Remember to start studying early! Office hours will get more crowded closer to the exam date.
- [HKN Tutoring](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/tutor/) <-- This is my go-to tutoring center for lab and homework assignments. Majority of the tutors are very familiar with CS61A and you will receive frequent help, often one-on-one. The tutors will walk through each problem and concept you are struggling with, and they are very friendly! However, they are not able to help on projects as it is against the HKN policy.
- [CS61A Labs](https://cs61a.org/weekly/) <-- CS61A Lab TAs will help you on lab, homework, and projects! You can attend multiple labs if the TAs allow you, and receive extra help!
- [CS61A Office Hours](https://cs61a.org/office-hours/) <-- Attend office hours early, especially for projects! Getting help will be increasingly more difficult closer to the due date of the assignment as the queue will become more crowded.
- [Online editor (support scheme, SQL and python)](https://code.cs61a.org/) <-- For debugging and testing out code in editor.

# Workload and Advice
CS61A is a extremely workload intensive class. Throughout the semester you will have three assignments each week: homework, lab, and checkpoints of a project. You will spend many hours each day to complete the assignments of the week, including office hours wait queue, debugging, improve conceptual understanding, and many attempts of passing all test cases. I highly recommend you do not take multiple technical and other workload intensive classes if you are taking CS61A, and make sure you are taking lighter courses on the side. If possible, meet with your academic advisor and schedule a appointment discussing your courses. Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed CS61A as much as I did :)
